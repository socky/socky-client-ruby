# Socky - client in Ruby
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/socky/socky-client-ruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/socky/socky-client-ruby) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/socky/socky-client-ruby.png)](http://gemnasium.com/socky/socky-client-ruby)

Also important information can be found on our [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/socky-users).

## Installation

``` bash
$ gem install socky-client --pre
```

## Usage

First require Socky Client:

``` ruby
require 'socky/client'
```

Then createn new Client instance. Parameters required are full address of Socky Server(including app name) and secret of app.

``` ruby
$socky_client = Socky::Client.new('http://ws.socky.org:3000/http/test_app', 'my_secret')
```

Please note that Ruby Client is HTTP client(not WebSocket) so you need to user http protocol(instead of 'ws') and 'http' namespace(instead of 'websocket'). If you receive EOFError then you probably should double-check address ;)

This instance of Socky Client can trigger events for all users of server. To do so you can use one of methods:

``` ruby
$socky_client.trigger!('my_event', :channel => 'my_channel', :data => 'my data') # Will raise on error
$socky_client.trigger('my_event', :channel => 'my_channel', :data => 'my data') # Will return false on error
$socky_client.trigger_async('my_event', :channel => 'my_channel', :data => 'my data') # Async method
```
